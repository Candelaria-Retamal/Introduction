My name is Candelaria Retamal and I am 26 years old. Currently
I am living in Switzerland, but I am Chilean. I studied Chemical 
Engineer and I graduated on 2020. During the past years I have
been working on an engineer consulting office that offers its
services to the mining industry in Chile.
In this context, I have done several projects related with 
satellite images and environmental monitoring of water and
vegetation systems. For this purpose, I have been encouraged to
work with big amounts of information which I have been processing
using python. During university I was taught to program using 
python; hence, I am familiarized with this coding languange.
Also, I am familiarized with matlab, as I have worked in several
ocassions with this software in areas related to modeling of 
fluid dynamics and chemically induced phenomena.
